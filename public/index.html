          <h3>Layout</h3>
          <p>This is the project of which I am the most proud. This was an early assignment and was a lot of fun to create. I worked very hard to get this as close to the modle as possible. I enjoyed the learning expirence this offered.</p>

          <h3>Tiles</h3>
          <p>This assignment was also an early one. It was a 'Tell me three facts about you' type of assignment. It was fun but difficutlt to make everything line up and act the way I wanted it to. I struggled with this because I did not set my tiles under
            the same naming category. This was a great learning step on how to organize my HTML.</p>

          <h3>Ties, Ties, Ties</h3>
          <p>This was an interesting assignment because it was a home page of an actual website we were replicating. I enjoyed the struggle on this one getting everything to line up as much as possible. I learned a lot obout flex-box on this project. I learned
            how to set up a flex grid and this has helped my on all of my projects since including this one! </p>
