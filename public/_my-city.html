            <p class="hover-text"><span>This Sad Soul</span></br>This is poor man was once playing piano in the park when a tear in the fabric of space and time occured. Outpoured a creature with yellow glowing eyes. The man tried to tell itto go back from whence it came and the creature did, but first shot him an evil glared that turned the man into metal. He has been there since 1902. Old Johnny Keystrokes they called him and his music still is played today in his memory.</p>

            <p class="hover-text"><span>Colosseum Court</span></br>This is the location of many brutal battles which were held to entertain the citizens o this country when times got bleak. Many famous gladiators "cut their teeth" in this court. There was Quick-feet McGavin, fastest footwork in all of the east. Grit and Grime Charlie, who would throw dirt and sand into his opponent's eyes as an ufair tactic. Paul "The Hammer" Stewart, he fought with a hammer. Last but not least, Ron "Dead Man" Diller, he was already dead but surprisingly killed many men as they would beat him until <em>they</em> died.</p>

            <p class="hover-text"><span>The Parthenon</span></br>This is actually a model. This is about as tall as a can of soda. Using clever camera tricks I was able to make this look like an enourmous structure. This paper mache arts and crafts project is the center piece of my model train display where I recreated the island of Greece. This display is of course just a small part of the larger display which is the entire continent of Europe.</p>

            <p class="hover-text"><span>Nashville</span></br>This is my city of Nashville. I have been here for about 13 years and it is a wonderful city to live in. There are constant streams of entertainment flooding into the city. You will never be bored on a weekend in Nashville. There are many restaurants which serve absolutely delicious food and the people are kind and fun to be around. Everyone is looking for a fun evening when they come to Nashville and those hopes lead to meeting some great people in the city.</p>
